#### CoreOS update philosophy

CoreOS believes _the ability to easily and automatically_ update software **is the most effective way** to improve server security.

To do so, they have implemented the [Omaha update protocol](https://github.com/google/omaha), defined by Google for the Chrome web browser on Windows.
The features provided by this protocol are:
- Atomicity
- Coordination
- Automatic rollback


The disturbing concepts are :
* Updates are **"pushed"**
* Updates are **automatically installed**

#### Update components

##### A - Update-engine

[Update-engine](https://github.com/coreos/update_engine)

The `update-engine` is the program in charge of:
- Downloading the update
- Installing the update
- And asking for a reboot to apply the update

>
> The Omaha protocol has a concept of "coordination" with "canary" servers, update window, ... but the `update-engine` is not in charge of it.
> This task is delegated to the `locksmith` utility tool.
>


##### B - Locksmith

[Locksmith](https://github.com/coreos/locksmith)

>
> locksmith is a reboot manager for the CoreOS update engine which **uses etcd** to ensure that only a subset of a cluster of machines are rebooting at any given time.
> `locksmithd` runs as a daemon on CoreOS machines and is responsible for controlling the reboot behaviour after updates.

#### Setp by step management

CoreOS "pushes" the updates... but,
- How can I **control which update is pushed** to my clusters ?
- How can I **control when** the updates are applied ?
- How can I **see and visualize** the state of the nodes ?
